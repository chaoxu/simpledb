simpledb
========

This is a custom version of Sciore's simpledb code by Chengyu Sun for CSULA-CS422. I have repackaged it to be used with Apache Ant (instead of Eclipse) for my course work.

A clean package can be built using the ant command in the package's root directory.

> ant

The simpledb server can be started using the following command:

> java -jar ./build/simpledb.jar [DATEBASE NAME]
